This project aims to grasp some basic techniques for image data classification task: 
- model's learning rate tuning using 'log-learning-rate/loss' plot;
- self-normalizing neural network building;
- regularization techniques;
- 1Cycle Policy (scheduling both learning rate and momentum value);
- MonteCarlo AlphaDropout.
